Angular redistribution matrix method
====================================

As described in the :ref:`overview <overview>`, the angular redistribution matrix method is used to couple the front and back
surfaces and calculate reflection, absorption, transmission and absorption profiles through matrix multiplication.
The key functions are :literal:`process_structure` and :literal:`calculate_RAT`.
