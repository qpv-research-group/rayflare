Open-source, integrated optical modelling of complex stacks. The aim of RayFlare is to provide a flexible, user-friendly
Python environment to model complex optical stacks, with a focus on solar cells. If you want to read more about the
optical models behind RayFlare, you can do that :ref:`here <overview>` or get started by looking at some
:ref:`examples <examples>`.
