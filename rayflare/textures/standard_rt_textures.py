    rough. The hemisphere is centered at the center of the unit cell.

    :param size: size of the unit cell; the units are arbitrary, but should be kept consistent across
    :param n_per_side: the number of grid points per side (total number of points will be n_per_side**2)
    :param radius: radius of the hemispherical cap
    :param offset: the hemisphere is shifted DOWN by this value (any points which end up below the z = 0 surface will be
                    removed from the surface)
    :param noise_angle: the maximum opening angle/surface normal angle that will be used to generate the random noise.
                    This is used to keep the height of the roughness for some noise_angle consistent with diferent n_points
    :param stretch: factor by which the height of the hemispherical cap is stretched (for ellipsoid rather than spheres)
